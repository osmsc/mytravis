 * The end point is not repeated.  Both the polygon (pgon) and the
 * test point (point) are 2D.  The returned result is 1 for inside, 0
 * for outside.  Haines indicates that the crossings multiply
 * algorithm is slightly faster than the crossings algorithm, and that
 * both of these are much better than the angle test.

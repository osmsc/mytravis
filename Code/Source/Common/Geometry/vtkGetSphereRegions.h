// .NAME vtkGetSphereRegions - Get Boundary Faces from poldata and label them with integers
// .SECTION Description
// vtkGetSphereRegions is a filter to extract the boundary surfaces of a model, separate the surace into multiple regions and number each region. 

// .SECTION Caveats
// To see the coloring of the lines you may have to set the ScalarMode
// instance variable of the mapper to SetScalarModeToUseCellData(). (This
// is only a problem if there are point data scalars.)

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkExtractEdges

/** @file vtkGetSphereRegions.h
 *  @brief This is a vtk filter to extract the boundaries from a vtk. It uses 
 *  the common conventions to be able to load this filter into Paraview and 
 *  use it as a filter.
 *  @details This filter is based off of the vtkFeatureEdges filter which
 *  finds lines and points that are defined as the separation between two 
 *  faces based on the angle difference in the normals between these faces

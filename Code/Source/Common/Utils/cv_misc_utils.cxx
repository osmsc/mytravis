// ------------------
// By epsilon, we're referring to the smallest quantity e which causes
// 1.0 + e to still be > 1.0.  (Note that tests against 0.0 is
// potentially misleading since there may be special hardware for 0.0
// arithmetic.)  More precisely, perhaps, the returned value e will be
// the smallest value s.t. values e' an order of magnitude or more
// smaller than e will not give 1.0 + e' > 1.0.  Also note that
// epsilon is completely different from the smallest double values
// which the machine can represent... instead, epsilon is the smallest
// *interval* which the machine can distinguish.

// Compute3dks
// -----------
// This function computes the principle curvatures, k1 and k2, given
// quantities for Gaussian curvature Kg and mean curvature Km.  Note
// that while we compute Kg and Km from the level set function, they
// are defined as:
//
//   Kg = k1 * k2        Km = (k1 + k2) / 2
//
// As such, we can solve for the two unknowns k1 and k2.  Note that
// while Km given this definition is ambiguous w.r.t. sign (i.e. a
// direction for the principle curvatures k1 and k2 determines their
// sign), Km as derived from the level set equation embeds information
// about inside vs. outside.  As a result, we can use additional
// information in the sign of Km in selecting the appropriate root of
// the quadratic.
//
// Note that the parameter ks must be able to hold 2 returned values:
//   ks[0] <--> k1
//   ks[1] <--> k2

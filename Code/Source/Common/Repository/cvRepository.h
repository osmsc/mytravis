// Class cvRepository provides a mechanism for storing objects and
// managing access to those objects.  By using cvRepository, other
// modules (e.g. in a Tcl environment) can depend on this shared
// resource instead of depending directly on each other.  Modules may
// read or write to the repository without needing to know about which
// other modules create or use those objects.  This improves
// abstraction among those modules, and potentially enables modules to
// be included or excluded from specific builds of, say, a Tcl
// application without disabling other modules.

// Using cvRepository also enables applications to manage data in-core
// instead of using other mechanisms (e.g. files... yeech...) for
// communicating between modules.  Modules share data in-core,
// eliminating all of the following:
//   - redundant in-core representations
//   - pollution of the filespace
//   - unnecessary file I/O
//   - unnecessary data structure allocation and initialization

// Clients should allocate objects to be put in the repository, but
// should NEVER delete those objects.  cvRepository assumes memory
// management responsibility for any object once it is registered.

// As far as the object name iterator is concerned, we will follow the
// rules set by the Tcl hash table package, which is what we're using
// to implement this table.  Those rules state that it is not safe to
// make changes to a table when a search (i.e. iterator) is active.
// Therefore, after any Register or UnRegister operation, InitIterator
// will need to be called anew to traverse the object names in the
// repository.  If a query is made (i.e. GetNextName) when that
// condition is not satisfied (i.e. the last call to InitIterator was
// prior to either a more recent Register or UnRegister), then
// GetNextName returns NULL.

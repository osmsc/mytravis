// Class cvLevelSetVelocity is being created in order to encapsulate all of the
// details of velocity function evaluation.  Previously, methods in
// class Grid were used to directly compute velocities.  Encapsulation
// of velocity parameters will serve to separate the mechanics of Grid
// maintenance from the details of particular velocity functions.

// Note that the code parameter to Evaluate is to be used to indicate
// the direction along with the given cvLevelSetNode's are adjacent.  This
// information should fall directly out of the cvLevelSetNode neighbor
// comparisons that will need to be done in preparation for calls to
// cvLevelSetVelocity::Evaluate.

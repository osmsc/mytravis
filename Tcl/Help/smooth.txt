# Smoothing a PolyData Model

Selecting any of the following surface operators will edit the entire surface of the model

## Surface Operators summary

        Smooth Poly Data Model: 
                smooths the bumps and ridges of the model
                Laplacian Smooth -> Relax Factor -> Choose between .01 and .05 


        Butterfly Subdivision:
                Divides the meshing triangles based on number placed in “Num Divisions”
                For example, to divide each triangle in half: Num Divisions = 1
                This creates a finer mesh made up of smaller triangles


        Decimate Surface:
                Based on target rate, makes the meshing triangles bigger
                

        WindowSync Smooth:
                Smooths more than Laplacian smooth
                still smooths caps of arteries

        Densify:
                divides triangles based on “Num Divisions”

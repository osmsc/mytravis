The tutorial tries to give you a feeling about how
to work with XF. The different chapters introduce
you into the general ideas, the handling and some
advanced features of XF. There is also a chapter
where we walk through a "simple sample session"
with XF, creating a small application.

The program we build is not complete but gives a
good survey of the features of XF and Tcl/Tk.
Our sample application will be a small directory
browser. The basic idea is to have a window, where
the current directory is displayed, and where you
can select files and directories to show their
contents.

During the work with XF you can call a help
facility. General questions are listed in the FAQ
files.}

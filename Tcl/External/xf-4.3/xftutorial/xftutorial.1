.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
XFtutorial allows to interactively introduce a user to
the usage of a Tcl/Tk program. The developer writes a
tutorial script, leading the user through the functionality
of the program. This program is part of the XF distribution,
and is used to introduce the user into the handling of XF.

.PP

The menubutton (\fBFile\fR) contains an item to print the
current help page, and to quit the program. The menubutton
(\fB Chapters\fR) contains all chapters that are available.
The text area displays the current help text. Below this
area, there are three buttons that control the paging of the
tutorial. Tutorial pages can have actions attached to them,
which are performed when the next page is selected, or the
Perform action button is pressed.

.SH "THE SCRIPT FILES"
The script files must contain input following certain rules.
One of the script files must define a global list named
chapterList. This list contains a list of lists. The first
element of the lists is the title of the chapter, followed
by the underline position of the menu item, and the script
name of this chapter. To insert a separator, an empty list
is inserted.

.PP
Each script file must define two variables first. The first
variable (\fB<chapter>Last\fR) specifies the last accessible
page number. The second variable
(\fB<chapter>LastSectionDone\fR) is an internal counter
initialized with -1.

.PP
Each page is represented by three variables. The first
variable (\fB<chapter>Name<pagenumber>\fR) contains the name
of the page. The second variable
(\fB<chapter>Text<pagenumber>\fR) contains the text to
display. And the third variable
(\fB<chapter>Command<pagenumber>\fR) contains the command to
be executed. This command is sent to the application that
uses the tutorial.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options can be controlled from the command line.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfBindFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing class bindings that implement
a default behavior of all widgets.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfColorFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
colors. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBColors\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfCursorFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
cursors. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBCursors\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfFontFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
fonts. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBFonts\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfLoading" 15
This option specifies that the program reports the source filenames
that it loads. This is useful when the program automatically accesses
archives in the development phase.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfLoadPath \fIpathname\fR" 15
This option specifies a list of pathnames (separated by ":") where
the Tcl source files can be found. In order to find the Tcl source
files they must be stored in one of these directories. 
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfModelColor" 15
This option starts the application in color mode.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfModelMono" 15
This option starts the application in monochrome mode.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfNoLoading" 15
This option specifies that the program does not report the source
filenames that it loads.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfStartup \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing additional Tcl/Tk code that is
loaded at startup. 
.\"
.IP "\fBscriptPath\fR" 15
This option specifies the directory where the script files are located.
.\"
.IP "\fBtargetInterpreter\fR" 15
This option specifies the interpreter that is the target for the
tutorial. 

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DISPLAY
The default display to be used.
.IP XF_LOAD_PATH 15
This variable specifies a list of pathnames (separated by ":") where
the Tcl source files can be found. In order to find the Tcl source
files they must be stored in one of these directories.

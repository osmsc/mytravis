XF is an interface builder based upon the Tcl/Tk package from John
Ousterhout. This tutorial tries to introduce you into the working
with XF. To use XF for more than just prototyping (creating a
graphical interface without functionality) it is necessary that
you can write Tcl code. This should be no problem, as Tcl is very
easy to learn and to use.

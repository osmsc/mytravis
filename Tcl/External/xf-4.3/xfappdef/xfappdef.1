.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
XFappdef allows to interactively manipulate an X Resource
file. It is possible to add and remove resource name
specifiers. There are menus, where all known program
classes are listed, and menus showing a set of commonly used
resource names. For certain resources, there exist special
dialogs, where the user can interactively select/specify the
value for a resource. The program has dialogs for Font,
Color, Cursor File and Pixmap selection.  This program is
part of the XF distribution and is used to manipulate the
XF resources, and the resources for the program that is
build with XF.

.PP
The upper list contains all resource specifications that are
given in the application resource file. The two buttons
below this list control the insertion and deletion of
resource specifiers. The entry contains the currently
selected resource specifier, or the name of a resource
specifier that should be inserted or deleted. The text field
contains the value of the currently selected resource
specifier, or the new value to be inserted. The buttons at
the bottom activate special dialogs that support the setting
of certain resource types.

.PP
To load, merge and save the resource file, the menubutton
(\fBFile\fR) is used. The menubutton (\fBClasses\fR)
provides access to all application class names that are
known. By selecting the menubutton (\fBResources\fR), a
selection of commonly used resource names can be accessed.
Selecting an application class name or a resource name
automatically inserts this value into the entry field that
shows the resource name specifier.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options can be controlled from the command line.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfBindFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing class bindings that implement
a default behavior of all widgets.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfColorFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
colors. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBColors\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfCursorFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
cursors. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBCursors\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfFontFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
fonts. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBFonts\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfLoading" 15
This option specifies that the program reports the source filenames
that it loads. This is useful when the program automatically accesses
archives in the development phase.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfLoadPath \fIpathname\fR" 15
This option specifies a list of pathnames (separated by ":") where
the Tcl source files can be found. In order to find the Tcl source
files they must be stored in one of these directories. 
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfModelColor" 15
This option starts the application in color mode.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfModelMono" 15
This option starts the application in monochrome mode.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfNoLoading" 15
This option specifies that the program does not report the source
filenames that it loads.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfStartup \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing additional Tcl/Tk code that is
loaded at startup. 
.\"
.IP "\fBfilename\fR" 15
The file name given at the commandline specifies the X Resource file
that is to be read and modified.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DISPLAY 15
The default display to be used.
.IP XF_COLOR_FILE 15
This variable specifies a file containing a list of all known
colors. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBColors\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.IP XF_CURSOR_FILE 15
This variable specifies a file containing a list of all known
cursors. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBCursors\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.IP XF_FONT_FILE 15
This variable specifies a file containing a list of all known
fonts. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBFonts\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.IP XF_LOAD_PATH 15
This variable specifies a list of pathnames (separated by ":") where

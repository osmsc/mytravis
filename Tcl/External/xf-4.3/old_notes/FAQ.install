Questions/Answers:
==================

I-1) What do I need for running XF ?
        You need Tk 8.0 or later.


I-2) How do I install XF ?
        Please unpack the XF distribution inside the
        directory where XF should be "officially" located
        (e.g. /usr/local/lib, or any other directory). The
        compressed tar file contains a directory tree named
        "xf/...". The installation procedure will not
        copy the XF files to another location. When the
        distribution is unpacked, you have to configure the
        Makefile. The Makefile contains some file- and path
        names that must correspond to your system. You only
        have to adapt the Makefile at the top of the
        distribution directory tree.

        Now you can type:

                make install

        with a running X11 server. During the installation,
        the installation procedure needs access to the
        program "xlsfonts" (part of the X11 core
        distribution). It is also necessary that it finds:

                rgb.txt (usually under /usr/lib/X11/),
                cursorfont.h (usually under /usr/include/X11/) and
                keysymdef.h (usually under /usr/include/X11/)

        at the locations configured via the Makefile. Once
        the various files (./lib/Colors etc.) have been
        created from these files, you can modify the created
        files as you need them (sorting, removing of
        uninteresting items, etc.).

        The default parameter settings (especially the file
        and pathnames) should be configured by the user. It
        is necessary that the user has writing permission to
        some files and path names. It may also be necessary
        to remove the old user configuration files.


I-3) How do I install the XF help system ?
        The XF package comes with preformatted html online
        documentation. You will need an HTML browser
        to show it. On Windows platforms, XF retrieves the 
        name of the browser from the registry. On UNIX
        platforms, XF first attempts to use netscape then
        mosaic.


I-4) Why does the installation not work on my machine ?
        You should first check if you have writing
        permission to the directories that you have
        specified as target directories in the Makefile
        (something like /usr/local/bin/X11,
        /usr/local/lib/X11/app-defaults,
        /usr/local/man/mann etc.).


I-5) Do I need shape ?
        No. The shapeToolkit is not needed for the
        installation. You can use it in XF to store
        procedures in a version database instead of storing
        them into standard UNIX files. But this is only a
        feature, not a requirement.


I-6) What is shape needed for ?
        The shape toolkit is used for the version control of
        procedures, and for version control of source
        modules. The shape toolkit is a collection of
        programs to support software configuration
        management in a UNIX environment. It consists of a
        set of version and attribute control commands and a
        building tool ("shape"). It should be installed on
        every "good" system :-).


I-7) Where can I get shape ?
	Shape is available at:
		ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de (pub/shapeTools/), and on
		gatekeeper.dec.com (pub/plan/shape)


I-8) What are the problems with old Tcl/Tk versions and XF ?
	It won't run with anything older than Tk 4.0.


I-9) Where do I get the widget XXX ?
	Generally ftp.aud.alcatel.com is a good place to
	look for it. The following list is not complete, but
	it directs you to the sites for the widgets that are
	supported by the distribution:

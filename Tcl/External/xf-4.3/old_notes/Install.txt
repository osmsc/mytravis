INSTALLING XF

Requirements:
-------------
This program is written for TLC/TK 8.0 or later.


Installation:
-------------
In case of problems and/or general questions, please first
take a look into the FAQ files that come with this package.

Please unpack the XF distribution inside the directory where
XF should be "officially" located (e.g. /usr/local/lib, or
any other directory). The compressed tar file contains a
directory tree named "xf/...". The installation procedure
will not copy the XF files to another location. When the
distribution is unpacked, you have to configure the
src/xfmain.tcl file. The file contains some path names
that must correspond to your system. 


Installing the help pages:
--------------------------
The XF package comes with preformatted html online
documentation. You will need an HTML browser to show
it. 

Using:
------
Before you start XF, please remove your old XF
configuration file (~/.xf-config). It may also be necessary
to remove the other local configuration files (menubar, and
iconbar definitions). This is important !!!

If you start XF, you get a normal wish window and the main
editing window of XF. (And the quest begins....:-)

If you have any problems, call the help facility of XF,
and/or read the FAQ's. Under General (Hints) you will find
some features and hints that will make life with XF much
easier.

If there occur errors during the work with XF that are
producing output to stderr, these errors are mirrored to the
file xferrors in the XF tmp directory. If you can say that
they are caused by XF or you are not sure, please send me
the file so that I can locate the problem.

To use the version control for procedures, you will need the
shape toolkit. The shape toolkit is a collection of programs
to support software configuration management in a UNIX
environment. It consists of a set of version and attribute
control commands and a building tool ("shape"). It should be
installed on every "good" system :-). Shape is available at
ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de. 

Bugs:
-----
- still in development (introducing new errors :-)

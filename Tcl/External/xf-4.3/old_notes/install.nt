INSTALLATION UNDER WINDOWS (TM)
-------------------------------

Installation:
-------------
        - Unpack the archive where you want it to reside.
        - Change the file ./src/xfmain.tcl
          in this file there is a section marked for 
          customization. Please adapt the variables there
          to fit your site.
        - There are two ways to run xf:
             in the MS-DOS shell type:
                wish <xfDir>/xfmain.tcl

             from the desktop register a new icon for xf with the 
             following command line:
                wish <xfDir>/xfmain.tcl
	- To run xfhardcopy and xfappdef you will have to change
          these files (to call the correct wish). Also copy the
          files (without the extension) to a directory where they
          can be found for execution.


Setting up Help:
----------------
To access the online help you might want to set the environment
variables HELPTCLTK and HELPXF. This string has to contain a valid
Tcl command that will get executed and as a result brings up the
help. A good example for a good setting is given below:

  HELPTCLTK:
  exec winhlp32.exe D:\users\sven\TCL\doc\tcltk41.hlp &
  HELPXF: 
  exec "c:/iexplore/microsoft internet/iexplore.exe" file:$xfPath(base)/Help/index.html &


Need more help ?
----------------
Well... quite frankly... I am not really an Windows expert... so
I am not sure if I can help you... maybe it is a good idea to
ask in the News group of the XF mailing list. Also 
drlabell@albany.net and hamel@republique.saclay.cea.fr may be able
to help (they independently ported XF to Windows).

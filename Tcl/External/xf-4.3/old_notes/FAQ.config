Questions/Answers:
==================

C-1) What to do when I get Tcl warnings about write permission
     and/or an XF alert box about writing errors ?
        When you run the program, it may be necessary to
        have write permission to the following directories
        and files (may be configured by you !):

                the help directory (./xfhelp/pages) and all descendants,
                the tmp directory (./tmp) and all descendants,
                the template directory (./templates) where you want to save,
                the config file (~/.xf-config).


C-2) I cannot save my configurations, what is wrong ?
	This problem is related with C-1. You must change
	the filename of your configuration file to a
	path/filename that allows you to write. To change
	this path/filename, activate the menu item
	(Options | Path/file names).


C-3) What to do if a key or mouse binding is not working ?
        If certain key (button or mouse) combinations don't
        work on your system, you have probably bound them to
        window manager actions. Either change the window
        manager bindings or (probably easier for you) change
        the bindings of XF to a combination that works via
        the (Options | Bindings) menu.


C-4) How can I make emacs the editor for XF ?
        Call the menu item (Options | General options), and
        set the editor command to: "emacs $xfFileName"


C-5) How can I make vi the editor for XF ?
        Call the menu item (Options | General options), and
        set the editor command to: "xterm -e vi $xfFileName"

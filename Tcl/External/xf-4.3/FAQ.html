Questions/Answers</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-1"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-1) How can I change the path/filenames
that are used by XF ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To change path/filenames that XF uses (i.e. if you don't have
writing permission), call the pull-down menu item (Options | Path/file
names).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-2"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-2) How can I create multiple
toplevel windows ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To create multiple toplevel windows you select the item "Toplevel"
from the "Standard" widget list.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-3"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-3) How can I show/hide toplevel
windows ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To display an XF created toplevel window, you should use the
automatically created function:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ShowWindow.toplevel</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To remove an XF created toplevel window, you should use the
automatically created function:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>DestroyWindow.toplevel</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>where "toplevel" is the name of the toplevel window that should
be displayed or removed . When you are running XF, please display and remove
the toplevel windows with the XF menu attached to the label (Current widget
path).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-4"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-4) How can I make a widget the
"current widget" ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Making a widget the "current widget" means that actions like
inserting a new widget or calling parameter setting will apply to this
widget.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To make a certain widget the "current widget", you can double
click the middle mouse button on the widget, or select the widget from
the pull-down menus that are bound to the single elements of the displayed
(Current widget path). These menus allow you to walk through the complete
widget hierarchy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>P.S. The "&lt;Double-B2>" selection does not work for menubuttons
due to binding collisions (You can change the binding if you want).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-5"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-5) How can I bind actions to
buttons ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To bind an action (procedure) to a button, first you create
the button, and then you call the parameter setting for this button (either
by making the button the current widget (R-4) and selecting the menu item
(Configuration | Parameters), or by a double click with your right mouse
button on the button widget).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Now you can edit the command string in the text field at the
bottom of the parameter window.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-6"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-6) How can I cut/copy/paste a
widget ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To cut/copy a widget, make it the current widget (R-4), and
select the menu item (Edit | Cut) or (Edit | Copy). To paste the cutbuffer
to the current widget, select the menu item (Edit | Paste). When you cut/copy/paste
widgets, please keep in mind that the widget names change. If the widget
names are used in commands, the commands must be adapted. If you refer
to the widgets via symbolic names, the symbolic name must be attached again
to the new widget.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-7"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-7) How can I delete a widget
?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To delete the "current widget", you have to select the menu
item (Edit | Delete).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-8"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-8) How can I create templates
?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To make a template, you simply put the widget structure you
want to save into the cut buffer. Then you select the menu item (Edit |
Save Cutbuffer (tmplt)). It is also possible to select (Misc | Module structure).
Here you have a checkbutton at the bottom, where you can specify that you
want to
<BR>handle templates. Now you can select procedures and a widget path.
If you click (Save), the currently selected procedures and the widget path
are saved to a file.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-9"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-9) How can I change the order
of menubutton items ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To change the position of a menu item in a menu, you select
the menu item in the item list of the menu, and then slide the scale at
right side of the children list.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-10"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-10) How can I change the order
of packed children ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To change the position of a widget in a packed parent, you
select the widget in the children list, and then slide the scale at right
side of the children list.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-11"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-11) How can I write my own procedures
?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a menu item (Programming | Procedures) which gives
you a window that allows full access to procedures. When inserting new
procedures, the
<BR>procedure list is rescanned. This takes some time, and you should not
click around during this time. This would probably activate the editing
for the
<BR>wrong procedure. The rescan can be turned off.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-12"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-12) How can I copy/paste between
text fields ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To select the text of an entry/text field, you simply press
the left mouse button over the text, and move the mouse with the pressed
button. To insert the selected text into another entry/text field, type
"&lt;Control-v>" or "&lt;Control-y>".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-13"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-13) How can I retrieve the name
of a specific widget ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To get the name of a specific widget, you can press "&lt;Modifier1-B2>"
(may be changed by you). This brings up a small window with the name of
the widget under the mouse pointer. The name is inserted into the selection
buffer as well, so you can insert the name into text fields by pressing
"&lt;Control-v>" or "&lt;Control-y>".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-14"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-14) </FONT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">How
can I write source that is evaluated before the created application is
actually started ?</FONT></H3>

<UL>This question sounds a bit complicated :-), but this is what is wanted:</UL>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including external modules at application
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; startup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parsing of passed arguments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something else ...:-).</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To insert source to the very beginning of the application,
you create a procedure named:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StartupSrc,</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>by selecting the menu item</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Programming | Startup source).</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To insert source to the beginning of the application after
the toplevel widgets have been created, you create a procedure named:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EndSrc,</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>by selecting the menu item (Programming | End source).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-15"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-15) Is there a way to select
colors/fonts etc. interactively ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>YES :-). To call a window with a color, font, cursor, keysym,
pixmap or file selection, you just have to double click the right mouse
button in the entry field that will contain the resource value.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-16"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-16) How can I set widget names
when they are created ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To define a reasonable widget name when the widget is created,
you can use the button (Configure and add) to create the widget. It is
also possible to set an option under (Options | General options). This
option is named (Ask for widget name on insertion). If this option is selected,
XF asks you for a widget name before a new widget (or template) is inserted.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-17"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-17) How can I change widget
names ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is not possible to change the widget name directly. But
(!!!) you can use symbolic names to access widget paths. Such a symbolic
name makes you independent from concrete widget hierarchies, and the name
can reflect the usage of the widget. There is also a new feature named
alias in XF. Here you can define a new name for an already existing command.
To call the alias handling select (Misc | Aliases).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-18"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-18) How can I access global
variables in the startup source ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To access global variables in the startup source (like "auto_path"
etc.), you have to make them available with the global command ("global
auto_path").</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-19"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-19) Why is my toplevel window
always placed at the same position by the window manager ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Your toplevel is placed at the position you (or the author
of the program) gave the toplevel. To make the window manager place your
window, call the parameter setting for the toplevel, and toggle the switch
(Set window position) and/or (Set window size).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-20"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-20) What should I do when I
get an error message to stderr ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If there occur errors during the work with XF that are producing
output to stderr, these errors are mirrored to the file xferrors in the
XF tmp directory. If you can say that they are caused by XF or you are
not sure, please send me the file so that I can locate the problem.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-21"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-21) How can I use the mouse
to arrange widgets?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Drag them with modifier1-button1 (Meta-Left Button on Sun Sparcs).
If you start dragging on the border, this will start the resizing. You
may want to set default geometry to Placer, and allow layouting without
the layout window, both in (Options | General).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-22"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-22) How can I set the values
of sliders more accurately ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Many sliders have to cover a wide range. The value of a slider
can be set with the cursor keys.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-23"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-23) How can I create menubars
?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To define a menubar, you create menubuttons that are all children of
one frame. A menubutton is only handled by XF if the underline resource
is set to something different than -1.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-24"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-24) Why doesn't the xftutorial
run ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Usually, there are two reasons why the XF tutorial is not running.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The first reason is that you probably started xftutorial from
the shell. Please run xftutrial from inside XF by selecting the menu item
(Help | Tutorial).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The second reason may be that your X server is not secure,
leading to an error message like this:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"X server insecure..."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In this case, take a look at the answer to question R-25.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="R-25"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">R-25) How can I make my X server
secure ?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Create the "~/.Xauthority" file on the systems you want to
use with Tk (use the tool xauth(1X)). Disable xhost access, and restart
the X server with
<BR>the -auth &lt;fileName> option, or under xdm(1X). Some users, on OpenWindows
systems, have reported that they need to log off and back on again to get
the window system to recognize the "~/.Xauthority" file.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you use xdm(1X), the "~/.Xauthority" file will be modified
automatically. If you call the X server by hand, you have to add certain
keys to the file using
<BR>xauth(1X). This will look about like this:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; key=`xauthkey`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xauth add ${HOST}:0&nbsp; . $key
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xauth add ${HOST}/unix:0&nbsp; . $key
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xinit $HOME/.xinitrc -- -auth $HOME/.Xauthority</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The program xauthkey is not part of the standard X system.
You just need a way to create a hexdecimal random number. This can also
be done by hand interactively. My "~/.Xauthority" file looked (a long time
ago) like this (call "xauth list" to view the file):</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garfield:0&nbsp; MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1&nbsp; 1234abcdef
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garfield/unix:0&nbsp; MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1&nbsp; 1234abcdef</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you still have problems, maybe the client that cannot connect
to your server has no access to your "~/.Xauthority" file, or the display
name you use is not the same as in your "~/.Xauthority" file. If you still
have trouble, build your Tk with the security flag disabled (SECURITY_FLAGS
in the Makefile) or take a deep look into the X security documentation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

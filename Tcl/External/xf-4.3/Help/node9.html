<P>
Thanks to the great flexibility and the simple handling of
<EM>Tcl/Tk</EM>
, and a very instructive and conceptionally clean
predecessor (named <EM>BYO</EM>
), it was easy to implement
<EM>XF</EM>
. There exists no real design of <EM>XF</EM>
. It was inspired
by the simple (but very powerful) concept of <EM>BYO</EM>
, and a
further development that I have done named <EM>XASK</EM>
. This
program provided a simple language for building a certain
type of simple graphical interfaces. These interfaces were
connected with traditional (non graphical) applications. As
there was no interface builder for this system and the
language was very limited, the arrival of <EM>Tcl/Tk </EM>
 and <EM>BYO </EM>
<P>
lead to the decision to switch to this more powerful
environment.
<P>
Three points were most important for the design of <EM>XF</EM>
. The
programm was supposed to be able to manipulate a running
application. This was important because this is the only way
to guarantee that the user really gets what he wants, and
can test the application without having to compile it or to
switch to a simulation mode. This restricted the choice of
implementation languages, as the application must be open
for modifications while it is running. One way would have
been to simulate the running application by writing an
interpreter for the implementation language (like C). The
other way was to use an interpreted language. The second
alternative was chosen. At this point, there were two
alternative languages available. The first language was
<EM>Tcl/Tk</EM>
, a package containing a scripting language and a
<EM> <IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2358" SRC="img7.gif"  > </EM>
-like widget set. The second language was elk, a
scheme interpreter with an interface to the X toolkit and
widget set based upon the X toolkit (This system is part of
the X contributed software). Due to a greater acceptance in
the community (and greater acceptance by the author of
<EM>XF</EM>
), <EM>Tcl </EM>
 was chosen.
<P>
The idea of manipulating an application with an interface
builder while it is running was taken from <EM>BYO</EM>
. This
approach has the advantage that it reduces the amount of
data that has to be used to store the contents of the
currently developed application. As all changes are directly
applied to the program, the program itself contains all
information which is necessary to create a <EM>Tcl/Tk </EM>
 file
containing the program definition. <EM>BYO </EM>
 achieves this by
using a <EM>Tk </EM>
 feature to communicate with the application
running in a different interpreter (see figure <A HREF="node50.html#figBYOdesign"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC=" cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>). This approach allows the simultaneous manipulation
of several applications.

<STRONG>Figure:</STRONG> BYO design<BR>
<P>
<P>
<EM>XF </EM>
 chooses a different approach. It uses one interpreter
for both programs (<EM>XF </EM>
 and the application to be built). The
name spaces of both programs (variables, procedures and
widgets) are separated by naming convention (see figure
<A HREF="node50.html#figXFdesign"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC=" cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>). This was originally done to reduce the
communication traffic, and to reduce the complexity of the
application. As the approach of <EM>BYO </EM>
 is more flexible, <EM>XF </EM>
<P>
will probably be adapted to (also) support this type of
manipulating an external application.

<P>
<P>
The second very important point was that the developer is
supported as much as possible. Newly created widgets are
created with reasonable default parameters, to prevent the
need of changing every newly created widget. Nevertheless,
every aspect of the application can be changed with <EM>XF</EM>
. If
this is not possible in a certain situation, or the user
does not want so much support, it is always possible to
change the code directly (by hand in an editor). While many
interface builders don't allow the manipulation of the
generated code, directly changed code can be reused with <EM>XF </EM>
<P>
without any restriction.
<P>
The third important point for the design of <EM>XF </EM>
 was to
allow the extension of <EM>XF </EM>
. There are several well defined
internal interfaces, where additional features (like new
layouting dialogs, or new widget configuration dialogs) can
be added to <EM>XF</EM>
. Furthermore, the user is able to adapt
most aspects of <EM>XF </EM>
 via interactive dialogs. This includes
the menubar and iconbar layout, the bindings that are used
to manipulate the application program and various aspects of
the <EM>XF </EM>
 dialog boxes.
<P>
The design of the interface of <EM>XF </EM>
 itself was also a very
important task. Like most interface builders, <EM>XF </EM>
 displays
the available widget classes in some kind of main window.
From here, all features of <EM>XF </EM>
 are activated. The various
features are implemented as additional dialogs, that are
popped up when they are activated. All configuration and
layouting dialogs are nonmodal, so that the user can change
parameters and the layout of various widgets simultaneously.

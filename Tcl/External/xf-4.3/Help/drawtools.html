<h2>XF and the Canvas Widget</h2>

<p>XF provides a configuration window to add, modify and delete
items on a TCL/TK canvas. A sample screen shot of the window
follows.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="canvconf.gif" width="440"

<p align="left">The configuration options on this window change
for each type of canvas object. This configuration window is used
primarily for creation and initial configuration of canvas
objects. Several other canvas drawing capabilities have been
added with the Draw Tools pop-up described next.</p>

<h2>Using <font color="#3333FF"><i>Draw Tools</i></font></h2>

<p>The canvas drawing capabilities of XF have been extended. A
Draw Tools toolbar may be displayed by pressing the new&nbsp;<img
src="tool.gif" width="22" height="22"> icon on the icon menu bar.
This will display the <font color="#3333FF"><i>Draw Tools</i></font>
window shown below. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="drawtool.gif" width="376"
height="145"> </p>

<p>The tools simplify the most common tasks associated with
shaping or arranging objects on a canvas. Additionally, canvas
objects may now be moved in permanently or temporarily defined
groups. </p>

<p>Before using the tools, the current working canvas must be
selected. A canvas must be selected at least once before the draw
tools can be used on it. This can be done in two ways. The canvas
widget path can be typed directly into the <i>Current Path</i>
entry box. This entry box will only accept the name of existing
canvas widgets. If the canvas does not yet exist, the original
entry box contents will be restored. The canvas path may also be
selected using mouse button one. Press and hold the mouse button
over the <i>Current Path</i> label. The mouse cursor will have a
question mark shape while the mouse button is held down. Move the
mouse pointer over the desired canvas then release the button.
This will automatically insert the name of the desired canvas
into the entry box. </p>

<p>The following draw modes are active when their respective
radio buttons are selected. A description of the draw modes
follows. </p>

<ol>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">GrpMove</font> - In this mode, a
        group of canvas objects may be highlighted using mouse
        button one and then moved as a group. Mouse button one is
        first used to enclose the group of object by stretching a
        yellow border around them. The border is defined by
        pressing and holding mouse button one while moving the
        mouse to enclose the objects. Releasing the mouse button
        causes the yellow border to snap back to surround only
        those objects completely enclosed by the border. The
        enclosed objects may then be moved by pressing and
        holding mouse button one, moving the objects to the
        desired location then releasing the button.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">Stretch</font> - Any vertex of any
        object may be moved in this draw mode. The object
        dynamically reshapes as its vertex is moved.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">Cut</font> - In this mode, a group
        of canvas objects may be highlighted using mouse button
        one and then deleted. The group is selected in the same
        manner as the <font color="#3333FF">GrpMove</font>
        option. Once the mouse button is released the objects are
        deleted. The objects may be restored by using the <b>Paste</b>
        button.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">Copy</font> - In this mode, a group
        of canvas objects may be highlighted using mouse button
        one and then copied as a group. The group is selected in
        the same manner as the <font color="#3333FF">GrpMove</font>
        option. A copy of the objects are created and placed over
        the originals. The new objects will remain highlighted by
        a yellow border. The new objects may then be moved by
        pressing and holding mouse button one, moving the objects
        to the desired location then releasing the button.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">OneMove</font> - This mode is used
        to move a single object at a time. Simply select the
        object with mouse button one, hold down the button and
        move the object to the desired location then release the
        mouse button.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">ObjMove</font> - ObjMove mode
        allows the user to move an arbitrary set of objects as a
        group. Canvas objects are grouped together using the <font
        color="#3333FF">Attach</font> mode. Press and hold mouse
        button one over a member of the object group, move the
        mouse to the desired location then release the mouse
        button. Objects in the group maintain their spatial
        relationship to each other.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">Attach</font> - In Attach mode,
        mouse button one can be used to attach a canvas object to
        an arbitrary object grouping. The objects do not have to
        be exclusively bounded by a common rectangular region.
        They may have any spacial relationship to each other.
        After several canvas objects are attached together, they
        can be selected to move as a unit when <font
        color="#3333FF">ObjMove</font> mode is active. When
        Attach mode is active, objects will&nbsp; be attached to
        either an existing complex object group or a new complex
        grouping will be created. This behavior is dependent of
        the first object selected after switching to Attach mode.
        If the first object selected is already part of a complex
        object, any selected object will be added to this same
        complex object. If the first object doesn't yet belong to
        a complex object group, any selected object will be added
        to a new complex grouping.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">Detach</font> - In Detach mode,
        mouse button one can be used to detach a canvas object
        from a more complex object grouping. Simply select the
        canvas object with mouse button one while in this mode.
        The selected object will be removed from any complex
        object grouping.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">ID</font> - This mode retrieves the
        item ID number for a canvas object. Pressing mouse button
        one over an object while in ID mode displays the ID
        number in the upper right corner of the <font
        color="#3333FF"><i>Draw Tools</i></font> window. When the
        canvas configuration window is open, this action will
        also select the canvas object in the configuration
        window.</li>
    <li><font color="#3333FF">None</font> - Select this item to
        turn off all draw modes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Press the <b>Paste</b> button to restore the last group of
objects that was <font color="#3333FF">Cut</font>. </p>

<p>Press the <b>Done</b> button to dismiss the <font
color="#3333FF"><i>Draw Tools</i></font> window. </p>

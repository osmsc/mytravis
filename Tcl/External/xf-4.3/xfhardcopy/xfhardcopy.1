.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
XFhardcopy allows to interactively select Tk applications
and path names inside these applications, for dumping to a
file. The program uses different external programs to
implement the hardcopy commands (xgrabsc 2.1, xwd), and it
provides access to the Tk postscript command for canvas
widgets. If the hardcopy commands that come with the
distribution do not work or if there exist more appropriate
programs, the hardcopy commands can be adapted by the user.
This program is part of the XF distribution, and is used to
make hardcopies from the program that is built with XF.

.PP
The Tk application which should be hardcopied can be
selected from the upper left list, and a widget path inside
of this application from the upper right list. To make a
hardcopy of the selected widget tree (application), one of
the hardcopy commands from the bottom list is selected with
a double click. By default the hardcopy is written into the
current directory under the name xfHardCopy. To specify a
different output file name, the hardcopy is made with the
menu item named (\fBFile | Hardcopy to...\fR).

.SH "HARDCOPY COMMANDS"
To modify the currently selected hardcopy command the menu
item (\fBFile | Modify hardcopy command\fR) is activated.
The following parameters can occur in the hardcopy commands
and are substituted when the hardcopy command is activated:
.\"
.IP "$height\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The height of the selected widget
.IP "$id\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The X window id of the selected widget
.IP "$outputFile\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The name of the specified output file
.IP "$rootx\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The absolute x position of the widget
.IP "$rooty\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The absolute y position of the widget
.IP "$widget\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The Tk widget name of the selected widget
.IP "$width\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The width of the selected widget
.IP "$x\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The relative x position of the widget
.IP "$y\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "
The relative y position of the widget

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options can be controlled from the command line.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfBindFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing class bindings that implement
a default behavior of all widgets.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfColorFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
colors. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBColors\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfCursorFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
cursors. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBCursors\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfFontFile \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing a list of all known
fonts. This file is automatically created when XF is installed,
so please set this variable to the location of the \fBFonts\fR
file of the installed XF (usually in the directory ./lib inside
the XF distribution).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfLoading" 15
This option specifies that the program reports the source filenames
that it loads. This is useful when the program automatically accesses
archives in the development phase.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfLoadPath \fIpathname\fR" 15
This option specifies a list of pathnames (separated by ":") where
the Tcl source files can be found. In order to find the Tcl source
files they must be stored in one of these directories. 
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfModelColor" 15
This option starts the application in color mode.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfModelMono" 15
This option starts the application in monochrome mode.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfNoLoading" 15
This option specifies that the program does not report the source
filenames that it loads.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-xfStartup \fIfilename\fR" 15
This option specifies a file containing additional Tcl/Tk code that is
loaded at startup. 

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DISPLAY
The default display to be used.
.IP XF_LOAD_PATH 15
This variable specifies a list of pathnames (separated by ":") where
the Tcl source files can be found. In order to find the Tcl source
files they must be stored in one of these directories.
